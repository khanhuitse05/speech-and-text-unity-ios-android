hello it's me i was wondering
if after all these years you'd like to meet to go over everything
they say that time's supposed to heal yeah
but i ain't done much healing
hello can you hear me?
i'm in california dreaming about who we used to be
when we were younger and free
i've forgotten how it felt before the world fell at our feet
there's such a difference between us
and a million miles
hello from the other side
i must've called a thousand times
to tell you i'm sorry for everything that i've done
but when i call you never seem to be home
hello from the outside 
at least i can say that i've tried 
to tell you i'm sorry for breaking your heart 
but it don't matter it clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore
hello how are you? 
it's so typical of me to talk about myself i'm sorry
i hope that you're well 
did you ever make it out of that town where nothing ever happened
it's no secret
that the both of us are running out of time
so hello from the other side
i must've called a thousand times
to tell you i'm sorry for everything that i've done
but when i call you never seem to be home
hello from the outside
at least i can say that i've tried
to tell you i'm sorry for breaking your heart
but it don't matter it clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore
